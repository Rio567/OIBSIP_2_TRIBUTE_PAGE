          which he was the youngest. Kalam's ancestors were wealthy traders and landowners and had vast land and
          property tracts. But with time, their business of ferrying pilgrims and trading groceries suffered huge losses

          make a living. At a tender age, Kalam had to sell newspapers to supplement his family income.
